Tag List widget plugin for Question2Answer
=================================================

This is a widget plugin for popular open source Q&A platform, [Question2Answer](http://www.question2answer.org). It is similar to the default tag cloud plugin but instead simply lists the most popular tags in a column, with the default tag style.



Installation & Usage
-------------------------------------------------

1. Download and extract the files to a subfolder such as `tag-list-widget` inside the `qa-plugins` folder of your Q2A installation.

2. Add the CSS below to your theme's stylesheet.

3. Go to Admin > Plugins and choose how many tags you wish to show (default is 30).

4. Go to Admin > Layout and click "Add widget" next to "Tag List". Choose the positions and pages, then save.



CSS
-------------------------------------------------

/* Tag List plugin */

.qa-sidepanel .qa-q-item-tag-item {
	display: block;
	margin: 3px 0 3px 20px;
}
